aite programming time
we gonna use android studio, not eclipse
theres a getting started thing in this repos somewhere, look at that
android sdk manager has way too many problems, if it, instead of opening, shows a cmd for like 1/2 a sec, ive collected some possible solutions here
-get rid of everything that has java in it via control panel uninstall things, then reinstall jdk 7.x.x; android 
studio doesn't support 8
-edit PATH system environment variable to 
"C:\Program Files\Java\[jre version]\bin\;C:\Program Files\Java\[jdk version]\bin\;C:\Windows\System32;"
in that order
-edit C:\Users\[name]\Appdata\Local\Android\android-sdk\tools\android.bat
	-eeeeeeehhhhhhhhhh i got bored im stopping now look up the rest with google
